# 📊 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier from Scratch

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm from scratch in Python, along with custom **evaluation metrics** such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

It is tested on:
- 🌸 **Iris Flower Dataset**
- 🗞️ **Custom News Dataset** (Text classification using TF-IDF)

Additionally, this project compares the custom KNN implementation with **scikit-learn’s** `KNeighborsClassifier` for performance analysis.
